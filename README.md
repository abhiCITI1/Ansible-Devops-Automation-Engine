Ansible and What it does - 

• What is Ansible ?
    Ansible is a configuration management and provisioning tool. With ansible we can automate our deployment process on web/app servers with the help of simple command line scripts. Setting up a server, starting, stopping, restarting and even running the server on a EC2 instance all these can be automated with the help of ansible playbook yml files.

In this tutorial we will go through the process of deploying a simple web page on a web server and the add the web server on an EC2 instance and then accessing the page through browser. All this through ansible. 

• Configure Ansible to deploy webserver, and bring it up a port port 80 with a web page that is publically accessible that displays the message: “Hello World”

• Include in the Ansible playbook, plays to deploy and un-deploy the resources (web server) from EC2.
